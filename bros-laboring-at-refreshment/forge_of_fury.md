# Character Notes:

* Yesod:
> A wandering Shifter Druid aligned with the Dream Circle. Ever searching for more insight into the condition of self-awareness that the various races seem to have above creatures, while at the same time strengthening the bond between himself and the natural world. Favorite shape shift is into mountain wolf, with large fangs and a thick silver coat. His greatest fear involves the noon day sun and an arid environment. His greatest aspiration is to achieve druidic enlightenment, becoming and arch druid and having a tangible connectedness with the unity of.... the universe. 

> Has no aversion to flame, as he understand destruction to have its necessary place in the circle of life. Overall has a greater tendency to be more offensive than defensive, and listen to the flow of the moment rather than be calculated. 

* Delah

spouse was called up as a conscript Bowyer during the <most recent> War when I was 10 and has yet to return home (I still holds out hope), but her spouse remarried. Without her first husband, (who was her childhood friend)  to temper her; she quickly grew out of control. She has since married 2 more spouses, only to have them die. She claims to not be responsible.

>One night, I heard a struggle downstairs and my mother was in a rage. There was a struggle.
And I do not remember the rest. I suffered a terrible emotional strain, which brought 
forth my latent magical power. 

>I survived the battle, but suffer from terrible nightmares in which I relive the experience.

>When I woke up I was some miles away from my home. I began to cast some minor cantrips without control. Scared, I RAN

>I never returned to the house, and have been running ever since. I have learned to control my some of my powers, but I still struggle to control my powers ever since.

# Adventure Log
## 5JUN2020
The party meets in the Yawning Portal seeking their next adventure...
## 3JULY2020
After consulting the map the part started out on the road. 

We came to a path leading through a dense forest we walked for a short distance. Not far on the path we saw a mountain with smoke rising from its top. The party decided that it might be a safer choice to leave the road and make their way though the forest in hopes of avoiding any traps or the notice of any goblins. 

After an extensive flex fest over who could walk through trees best (a rich kid with survival experience or a humanoid/animal hybrid thing) Yessod led the way. During our lovely walk through the trees we came upon a clearing full of boars (they looked like rats but whatever).

During the combat the herd of boars (borats) charged to take on Yessid and Thodris quickly came to his aid.  Unfortunately for Yessod, Thodris crit failed his attack and struck his party member. Other highlights include Bhat Manzor being a GOD with a bow, Skarus practicing his social distancing, and Delah using her first bit of WILD MAGIC. The effect being that she grew a third eye and a wisdom buff for the remainder of our combat. 

The team cleaned up pretty quickly without taking too much damage. 

After a short rest, Skarus sent his familiar to fly to the source of the smoke and investigate what might be the cause. (Why the hell didn’t we do that from the beginning? Noobs…) The smoke was coming from a natural chimney and there were no signs of life. The party turned back to the road. 

We made our way back to the road and Bhat Mazor led the way while checking for any traps. None being found we arrived at the end and came to a narrow path. Bhat Manzor, being the sneaky son of a bitch that he is, snuck up the road to scout and found a couple of orc standing guard. 

Reporting this back to the party we decided that the best course of action was to shoot an arrow down the pass and draw our enemies down the road. 
## 10JULY2020
Continuing our adventure, we set a plan for attacking the orcs. Bhat Manzor shot at one with his long bow while the casters all focused on the other. The arrow hit and the spells all whiffed. The result was both orcs making a mad dash down the path shouting the alarm. 

The party rushed forward to try to catch them. Bhat Manzor managed to take down one with his bow and Thodris caught up to the other. Unfortunately, the orc was able to get away and we began taking fire from the arrow slits above. With some fast thinking Yessod created a fog to block visibility from the arrow slit allowing the party to move forward. 

Further down the path the party was met with a large stone door and another archer in an arrow slit. After much struggle the party managed to kill the archer (sorry I don't remember who killed him) they changed their focus to the large stone door. It seemed to be impossible to open. It couldn’t be climbed or knocked down (even if you shook the earth under the doors). 

Skarus, the absolute legend, walks right up to the gate and puffs into a cloud of smoke. Appearing on the other side, he lifts the bar to open the gate. We are met with a large pit (40ft across) and a rope bridge that has been cut. The party manages to find some hidden doors leading to the arrow slits and grabs all of the ears of the enemies that had been slain.  We ended the night with a long rest. Discussing  how we were going to make it across.
